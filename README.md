# z/OSÂ FTP Emulator

## Why this emulator

You can access z/OS in two ways, the UNIX one and the MVS one. When accessing
z/OS with a FTP client, you will usually see only the UNIX tree folder. But
sometime, you want to access the MVS tree structure, to do so, you have to
use a FTP client that supports z/OS FTP server.

I have done this emulator because I have added z/OS support to NppFTP (a
plugin of Notepad++) but the maintainer couldn't test the patch. With this
emulator, he can test it and improve it.

## How to use it

1. Clone this repository
2. `python3 setup.py install`
3. `cd example`
4. `zosftp`

You have now a FTP server listening on port 2121.

To test it, in your FTP client, use 'TSODIQ1' as base path (with the quote).

For GDG, use 'TSODIQ1.GDGTEXT' and 'TSODIQ1.FOLDER'.

For Sequential Datasets, use 'TSODIQ1.FOLDER.FOLDERTXT'

## To build this into a Docker container
docker build -t <tag> .

## To run Docker container
docker run -p 2121:2121 -p 60000-60009:60000-60009 --rm <tag>

Now you can FTP to localhost:2121 to get to the FTP server inside the container.
